# Lesson Types

## COURSES

Your Flatiron School program is broken up into courses. Each course represents a
section of our core curriculum.

## MODULES

Flatiron School organizes content within courses by breaking them up into
modules.  The modules will control the entire flow of the course and within them
you'll find all your lessons, labs, assignments, and quizzes for the course.
Modules can be filled with different types of content:

- **Page:** a page of content to read
- **Discussion:** a course discussion in which teachers and students can
  actively participate
- **Quiz:** a course quiz
- **Assignment:** a course assignment
- **Link or External Tool:** an external link or tool to view information
  outside of the course
- **File:** a file to download or view

You may be required to perform certain actions to complete a module.
Requirements may include:

- **View:** You must view the item.
- **Mark as done:** You must mark the module item as done before you can
  progress to the next item.
- **Contribute:** You must post a reply to the discussion topic or contribute
  content to a page.
- **Submit:** You must submit the assignment, graded discussion, or quiz.
- **Score at least X points:** You must submit the assignment with a minimum
  of the shown score.

You can find the 'Modules' button on the Sidebar on the left hand side within
each course.

## ASSIGNMENTS

While the module controls the flow of the entire course, you can also access a
running list of your course assignments via the 'Assignments' button on your
Sidebar in the left hand side within the course.  

By default, assignments are grouped by overdue assignments, upcoming
assignments, undated assignments, and past assignments.

Each assignment includes an icon designating where it's an assignment,
discussion, or quiz and will also display availability dates, due dates, and the
number of points the assignment is worth.

You can find the 'Assignments' button on the Sidebar on the left hand side
within each course.
